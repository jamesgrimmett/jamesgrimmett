Hello world, I’m James Grimmett.

Here you'll find various pieces of code that I've been tinkering with.
I have a strong interest in Astrophysics and scientific software, along with a growing interest in data science and machine learning. Most of the code here is related to those two topics.

For example;
- [SimpleGCE](https://github.com/jamesgrimmett/simple_gce) is a one-zone Galactic Chemical Evolution model written in Python. It can be used to study the evolution of the chemical abundances in a model galaxy, and was used in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05901).
- [SatelliteData](https://github.com/jamesgrimmett/satellite_data) is a Python tool for fetching and plotting data describing the Earth's artificial satellite population.

You can find more of my work on my personal [website](https://space-etc.herokuapp.com/).
